# Khan-Bot

An alternative to Alex Dubov's Khan Bot with a different method of getting answers and works for graphing


How it works:

Basically this hack overrides a javascript file inside of Khan Academy to create a variable named "y" which has the answer stored, the way I override is I fetch
the modified file from the github and I convert it to text and then eval it, this allows us to get the answer.

How to use it:

1. Go to bookmark.js
2. copy the contents
3. make a bookmark on any website, click more, click edit, change the URL to the contents of bookmark.js
4. click the bookmark on khan academy before entering an exercise
5. pray to god it works

Extension coming maybe

I also have a way of adding points (I think) updates soon I guess.

Discord soon maybe???
If it doesn't work just make an issue and I will fix it.

jmenu sucks rofl
